This is a small React application which uses:

###Formik to handle form:
  1. Getting values in and out of form state (instead using useState() & useEffect() in a very complicated way)
  2. Validation and error messages (have to write your own validators or use a 3rd-party helper library)
  3. Handling form submission
  
###Yup to validate field's values (3rd-party helper library we need)
  Formik has a special configuration prop for Yup called validationSchema

In the project directory, you can run: `npm start` to see how things work out . Enjoy :)

Runs the app in the development mode.
